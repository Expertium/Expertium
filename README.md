I write about spaced repetition. That's all, end of the intro.

1. [Benchmark of spaced repetition algorithms](https://github.com/Expertium/Expertium/blob/main/Benchmark.md). In this article I analyze data from the [open spaced repetition benchmark repository](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark?tab=readme-ov-file#result), which compares many modern algorithms based on their ability to predict the probability of recall.
